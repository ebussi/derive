## Site 1 - Footlocker
-https://www.footlocker.ca/?SID=5565&inceptor=1&cm_mmc=paid%20search-_-bing-_-o-_-branded-_--_--_-p-_--_--_-302213640-_--_-1306219917893530-_-textads-_-p31067127869-_-81638761628569-_--_--_-&msclkid=0052d04cee0b1607b72c8c0eed6124f1&utm_source=bing&utm_medium=cpc&utm_campaign=B%20-%20%5BB%5D%20-%20Brand%20Terms&utm_term=foot%20locker&utm_content=B%20-%20%5BB%5D%20-%20Brand%20Terms&gclid=CPi9h8Xk998CFdb0swodVG4PIA&gclsrc=ds
-I was on Facebook and an add for Nike Air Max's popped up
- The overall design of the website has a modern look to it.the high resolution photos of the shoes really brings out the modern feel.
The website also has a clean and simple design stemming for the menu bar to the faq section at the bottom of the website.
- The navigation system is very easy to use. All buttons that bring you to the different sections of the site are clearly labled at the top of the website. It is not at all difficult to use.
- Every part of this website is interactive. The menu bar, the photos displayed on the main page, all items under each category.
- The site is very simple yet appealing. It is a very useful tool if one cannot physically go to an actual Footlocker location.
- One thing that I would change about the website is to implement an option for contact information in the top menu bar. Their contact info is at the very bottom of the site and having it at the top could save people like % seconds.

## Site 2 - Forbes
- https://www.forbes.com/#5c2d70112254
- Saw a current story on twitter about Jeff Bezos and clicked on it 
- Forbes has a cuurent look to it. When hovering over the topics in the menu bar, the selections within those topics appear instantly, no clicking rerquired. They also have a cool feature where it shows the current number of readers on the site.
- Navagation system is simple to use. Everything is clearly labled so there is no difficulties on how to get wherever you need to be.
- There are no parts of this website that are not interactive. Everything has the ability to be clicked on and bring you to a new page.
- The site in my opinion is a good website. It's an interesting way to find out random news that no one really needs to know about. 
- There is nothing that I would change about this website. It is already simple enough to navigate and has a very clean look to it.

## Site 3 - Reddit
- https://www.reddit.com/
- Friends telling about Pewdiepie's sub reddit, went to go check it out
- The design of Reddit does not look current. If anything it looks like a website that was made in the early 2000's but has been maintained very well since it's creation.
- The navagation system looks outdated, but it is pretty easy to use. Like every good website all links are labeled correctly and bring you to where you need to be. Their search bar is just a search bar so it is as simple as can be.
- All links on the site are inteactive as well as ad's and pictures. I have not found anything that does not have the ability to be interacted with.
- I like Reddit, always have. It's a very useful tool for people who are bored, and it is a beautiful site in it's own way.
- I would change the design of the site. Sure Reddit is Reddit and should not be changed because it will more than likely upset many, but I think it needs an upgrade to look more modern.

## Site 4 - AutoTrader
- https://www.autotrader.ca/?utm_source=bing&utm_medium=cpc&utm_campaign=CA-SEM-DM-EN-BRAND&msclkid=a33d13b5035013db175a4ff716341aff
- Searched it on Google. I like to look at cars that I will never have...
- It is a cuurent/modern design for the site. It's a busy site, there are a lot of ad's for random dealerships. The design for the menus and borders for pictures are very sharp and professional looking.
- The navigation system isfitting for the site. It allows you to specify which make, model, year, and price range of car you are looking for. There are alos options to shop boats and RV's which is quite convenient for the random person who needs an RV or boat. It is a fairly simple system to use.
- Most parts of the site are interactice except for their partners section, which should be interactive and have the ability to forward you to their respective websites.
- It is a useful website for those who want to have a quick search of some cars that they are interested in. It is definitely a time and gas saver. It's an appealing site, but it is a bit boring.
- Make the partners logos interactive.

## Site 5 - Environment Canada
- https://weather.gc.ca/city/pages/on-107_metric_e.html
- Twitter. Weather warning showed up and I followed the link to the site.
- The design is not current, Looks like it was created in 2010. The website is just not as modern looking as The Weather Channel's website.
- It's a website for the Government of Canada so it has a bunch on links to Jobs, Immigration, etc. Everything is properly labeled and easy to find especially with the search-bar. But in order to get to Environment Canada you have to search it on a browser... Lame.
- Everything but the pictures on this website are interactive.
- The site is meant to be an informative website so I get why it is not completely modernized. Many Canadians use this site and would probably get lost if changes were made. This website is definitely useful.
- One thing I would change about this site is the appearence. I looks outdated and it is just not appealing.
